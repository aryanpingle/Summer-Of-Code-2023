# My Google Summer of Code, 2023

## Project Goals

* Adding a Modal component to display verbose information to the users
* Providing explanations for each codec's parameters
* Adding the Quite OK Image Format to Squoosh
* Updating existing image codecs
* Improving the documentation for existing image codecs

## What I Accomplished

> Adding a Modal component to display verbose information to the users

[I created a Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/pull/1369) that's currently in-review. 

> Providing explanations for each codec's parameters

I plan to explain these parameters to the user via the new Modal component... so this will be pending until I finish the Modal PR.

> Adding the Quite OK Image Format to Squoosh

[Successfully added it to Squoosh](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/pull/1384)! I plan on writing a detailed blog on this **blazingly fast** new image format, so stay tuned for that.

> Updating existing image codecs

[I created a PR to update the AVIF codec](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/pull/1381), which is currently in-review. Thanks to Wan-Teh Chang, it's nearly complete and will (hopefully) be merged soon.

> Improving the documentation for existing image codecs

Squoosh's codec workflow is as complex as it is robust. I plan to include a short guide to adding your own codec to Squoosh, within the QOI Blog.

## What I Learnt

* Always clear your caches.
* It's not just alright to ask for help - it's paramount to becoming a better developer.
* Communication is key! Keep your mentors informed, and make sure to run your ideas past them. More often than not, they will guide you to better ones.
